# CouponOrganizer
This is an extrememly lightweight program which runs on a simple webserver and allows for a user to upload coupons and sort them by expiration date, merchant, etc. Instead of keeping all of your coupons in your email account, now you can organize them online!

## Installation process
Download the repo. Move the contents to your webserver's wwwroot location. Navigate to the index.php file through your favorite web browser. Enjoy!

## Compatibility
I've successfully used this program on the following webservers:
- Microsoft IIS 7.5
- Apache (unsure of version, will update later)

### To do
- Reenable the sorting functionality
- Create garbageCollection function that erases all coupons which have expired
